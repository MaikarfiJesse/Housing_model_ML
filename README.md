# Optimization Techniques
**Data Preprocessing**
Before diving into model training, it's crucial to preprocess the data to enhance the model's performance.

# Handling Missing Values
**Technique:** Removal of Less Important Columns
**Explanation**: Columns like 'title,' 'town,' and 'state' were identified as less important and removed before training the model.

# Outlier Removal
**Technique:** IQR-based Outlier Removal
**Explanation:** Outliers in the 'price' column were detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve the model's robustness.

# Feature Engineering

# Dropping Unused Categorical Features

**Technique:** Dropping 'title,' 'town,' and 'state'
**Explanation:** Unused categorical features were dropped from the dataset to streamline the input features for model training.

**Model Training**
For the task of predicting house prices, a neural network was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

# Model Architecture

**Technique:** Neural Network Architecture
**Explanation:** A sequential model with dense layers, dropout for regularization, and the Adam optimizer was employed to learn and generalize from the data.

# Loss Function and Regularization

**Technique:** Binary Crossentropy Loss and L2 Regularization
**Explanation:** Binary cross-entropy loss was chosen for regression, and L2 regularization was applied to prevent overfitting.

# Callbacks for Early Stopping

**Technique:** EarlyStopping Callback
**Explanation:** EarlyStopping was implemented to halt training if there is no improvement in the validation loss, preventing overfitting and reducing training time.

# Evaluation Metrics

# Regression Metrics
**Technique:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**Explanation:** MSE and MAE were used to evaluate the regression model's performance in predicting house prices.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

# Learning Rate
**Technique:** Adaptive Learning Rate (Adam Optimizer)
**Explanation:** The Adam optimizer, with its adaptive learning rate mechanism, was utilized to adjust the learning rate during training automatically, improving convergence speed.

# Model Variations

# L2 Regularization
**Technique:** L2 Regularization in Model Architecture
**Explanation:** L2 regularization was applied to certain layers in the neural network architecture to prevent overfitting further.

# Data Splitting and Preprocessing
**Technique:** Data Splitting and Preprocessing
**Explanation:** The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets. Numerical features were standardized, and unused categorical features were dropped.

# Prediction and Testing
**Technique:** Price Prediction and Testing
**Explanation:** The trained models were evaluated on the test set using mean squared error and mean absolute error metrics. Additionally, the models were used to make predictions for new data points.

# Conclusion
The optimization techniques employed in the Housep project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model architecture, evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and model variations, contribute to the overall effectiveness of the predictive model. Parameters were selected based on careful consideration of their impact on model performance, and their values were justified through experimentation and observation. The implementation aims to accurately predict house prices in Lagos by leveraging various optimization strategies.
